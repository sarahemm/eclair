# locations - start addresses of instructions

# it makes the circuitry simpler to have these as separate cases, but we handle them the same
location    dma_req         2
location    dma_and_int_req 3

# instructions - actual implementation microcode

# we go back to fetch2, then fetch2 will send control back here if dma_req is still high
